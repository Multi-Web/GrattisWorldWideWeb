    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Helloooo, World Wide Web!</h3>
    <p> This website is through <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a> and it's hosting it for freee!<br>
      
        Hi! I'm trying to learn Web programming so I'll keep filling this site with all sorts of things, 
        hopefully <em>"usefull"</em> things regarding what one can consume on the INTERNET and again, I'm doing it in a slow pace but once I pick up some speed, i'll have a
        fixed date where i'll update it regularly! 
     
    </p>

  <h5>Goals for the site</h5>
  <ul>
    Make it look modern.. 
    Have some content!
    Have an ad?  
  </ul>
